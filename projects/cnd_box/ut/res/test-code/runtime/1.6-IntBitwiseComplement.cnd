@brief When we apply complement operation, on any bit, it becomes 0, 1 and becomes 1, 0

Suppose we have a variable named 'a' whose value is
a = -9;
This result is obtained by converting the value 8 in the variable a to binary.
a = 0111
When we apply bitwise complement operator in the operand, the output will be:
Result = 1000 (8)
`/

proc @root:
  main:{
	def @a:-9;
	return ~a;
  }
